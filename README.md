Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm @simone-macri, and here's a bit about me:

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in...

I have a deep passion for new technologies, specializing in the development of web applications, both backend and frontend. I'm also highly interested in cloud technologies, especially AWS, which I consider fundamental for the modern application architecture.

Thank you for visiting my profile! Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you're interested in collaborating or just want to exchange ideas.
